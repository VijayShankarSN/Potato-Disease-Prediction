## Description

Potato Disease Prediction

Potato Disease Prediction is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing agricultural practices by leveraging cutting-edge technology to predict and diagnose diseases in potato plants. Employing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project utilizes TensorFlow, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data augmentation, and TensorFlow Dataset to accurately detect and classify various diseases affecting potato crops.

**Key Features:**

1. **Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms:** The project harnesses the power of TensorFlow, a leading machine learning framework, to develop robust models capable of accurately predicting potato diseases.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are employed to effectively capture intricate patterns and features within potato plant images, enabling precise disease identification.

3. **Data Augmentation:** Augmenting the dataset enhances model generalization by generating variations of input images, thereby enriching the training process and improving model performance.

4. **FastAPI Backend:** The backend infrastructure is built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI ensures efficient communication between the frontend and backend components, facilitating seamless data processing and prediction.

5. **Model Optimization:** To enhance efficiency and deploy the model on resource-constrained devices, optimization techniques such as quantization and TensorFlow Lite are implemented, reducing model size while maintaining high accuracy.

6. **HTML Frontend:** The frontend interface is developed using HTML, providing users with an intuitive and user-friendly platform to interact with the application, upload images, and receive disease predictions.

**Project Structure:**

The project is structured into distinct components for seamless integration and modularity:

| Component             | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection       | Acquisition and preprocessing of potato plant image dataset   |
| Model Development     | Training CNN models using TensorFlow and data augmentation   |
| Backend Development   | Implementation of FastAPI backend for data processing         |
| Model Optimization    | Optimization techniques like quantization and TensorFlow Lite |
